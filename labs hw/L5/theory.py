1 a. 2n-1 theta(n)
b. 2n-1 theta(n)
c. (sqrt n * sqrt n+1)/2 theta(n)
d. 2sqrt n -1 sqrt n

2 a. theta(log n) since i is increasing by 2
b. theta( n log n) since it goes through every item in list to print? and log n since i reduces by2
c. n since i increases by 2* speed but print list increases exponentially

3a. o(1) and o(n)
b. o(n) and o(n^2)

4ai continuous_number_list, ii O(n) and O(n)

bi number_sums, ii O(n) outer loop and inner loop n times each and O(n) since max space is full list

ci is_palindrome, ii O(n) and O(n) since max time is n and space is 2n
