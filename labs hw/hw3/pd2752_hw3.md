# Q1
### 1
1. While loop runs n times
2. Insert shifts all elements by 1, therefore does n operations
3. Thus time complxity is O(n^2) 


### 2
1. While loop runs n times
2. Append takes constant time
3. thus time complexity is O(n)

# Q2
### c)
- Doubling and 4x shrinking keeps size between n and 4n 
- The append() and pop() taking O(n)
- Thus cost is also O(n)
- THerefore total complexity is O(n^2)

# Q3
1. Makes array of n items
2. Loop 1 takes O(n)
3. Loop 2 does n-1,
thus time is O(n)

# Q4
### a)
1. Loop runs n times
2. Remove() is called in loop n times and takes n operations
3. Thus time is n*n O(n^2)

### c)
1. Loop runs n times
2. Pop is constant time
3. thus time is O(n)
