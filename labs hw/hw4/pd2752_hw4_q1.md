###### 1)
base case: return last element if its got length of 1
recusrion: create sublist of list[1:] and add to index 0, keep shrinking list till base case is reached

###### 2)
![[hw4 q1p2 recursive tree.excalidraw]]
- first version
	- each recursive call makes a slice of list costing O(n-i) where i increases by 1 each for each recursive call making total time into $n(n-1)$ which gives $O(n^2)$ (quadrati ctime)
- second version
	- each call performs only constant time operation sthere fore the total number of calls is $n$ each taking constant time making the total $O(n^2)$ (linear time)
###### 3)
second version is much faster since it takes less time per call
